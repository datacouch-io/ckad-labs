## Welcome to the Kubernetes Labs!

We are excited to have you here to embark on your journey to learn Kubernetes. These labs are designed to provide you with hands-on resources and practical exercises to help you gain a solid understanding of Kubernetes, the leading open source container orchestration platform.

Throughout these labs, you will have the opportunity to work with Kubernetes in a simulated environment, allowing you to experiment, explore, and deepen your knowledge of its key concepts and functionalities.

Our aim is to provide you with a comprehensive learning experience that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application. You will have access to step-by-step instructions, code examples, and interactive exercises to guide you through each lab. Whether you are new to Kubernetes or looking to enhance your existing skills, these labs will help you build a strong foundation and become proficient in working with Kubernetes.

We encourage you to actively engage in the labs, ask questions, and seek assistance whenever needed. Remember, learning Kubernetes is a continuous process, and these labs are just the beginning of your journey. Embrace the challenges, enjoy the discoveries, and let's dive into the exciting world of Kubernetes together!

Happy exploring and have a fantastic learning experience!

## Pre-requisites
Before getting started with the Kubernetes labs, please ensure that you have the following:

For the lab session, a browser-based lab environment has been set up, and the instructor will share the necessary credentials with you.

## System Requirements
To effectively use the lab environment, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

* Use any modern browser such as Safari, Chrome, etc.
* Open the browser in incognito mode.
* Ensure you have a stable internet connection with at least 100 Mbps speed.

## Download your repo:
* Open a terminal (PowerShell on Windows; any shell on Linux/macOS).
* Run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/datacouch-io/ckad-labs.git`
* Navigate to the cloned folder: `cd ckad-labs`

You're now ready to dive into the Kubernetes labs and enhance your understanding of this powerful container orchestration platform. Enjoy the hands-on experience!
